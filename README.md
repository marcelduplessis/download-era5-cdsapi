# download-era5-cdsapi

Tools to download Copernicus ERA5 data directly from Python. The data is then saved in a directory you decide. This module is useful if you don't want to go through the web interface to download the data. 

This has the obvious advantage of not having to download and store the data on your local computer, which can quicly add up to terrabytes if you're looking for long term data.
